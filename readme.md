# Feedback

## Usability Session 1

**Passenger Notes:** I noticed that the site lacks functionality.

**Driver Notes:** User 1 noticed that some of the functionality was missing in my draft (add to carts, signup, etc.)

**Takeaways:** I plan to change to add this functionality.

## Usability Session 2

**Passenger Notes:** I noticed that the layout is a little confusing.

**Driver Notes:** User 2 noticed that the layout of the site was not ideal, the CSS was messy.
